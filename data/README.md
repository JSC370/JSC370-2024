The Integrated Surface Database (ISD) consists of global hourly and synoptic observations compiled from numerous sources into a single common ASCII format and common data model. ISD was developed as a joint activity within Asheville's Federal Climate Complex. NCEI, with U.S. Air Force and Navy partners, began the effort in 1998 with the assistance of external funding from several sources. ISD integrates data from over 100 original data sources, including numerous data formats that were key-entered from paper forms during the 1950sâ€“1970s time frame.

This dataset is a subset of these data, in particular, US data only.
